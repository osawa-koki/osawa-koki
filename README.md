## 自己紹介

「たこさんマークのエンジニア」のおおさわです。  
セキュリティ系のプログラムだったり、ブラウザで動作する簡単なツールを開発したりしています。  

特に意味のないプログラムを作るのが好きです。  

## For English Speakers

Hello, I am an "Octopus marked software engineer".  
"Octopus marked software engineer" is a simple wordplay (or funny joke? in japan).  
Not having a deep meaning...  

I started programming when aged 20 or a bit younger (of 2nd stage of Univ), though I was majoring in Accouting.  
A main purpose of my program was to calculate stock price automatically.  

Then, forwarded for the road of security engineer.  
The reason I took that way was obscure, probably having had an good impression for security technology something cool or ...  

Now in 2022, started working web company as a security engineer.  
Checking webapp-based vulnerabilities such as 'SQL injection' 'XML injection' 'XSS' 'Authentication failure'.

Especially, because we perform deploy EC site which uses creditcard,  spending much time making rules to follow PCI-DSS like down below.  

- File Falsification detect tool.
- CSP setting failure detect tool.
- SQL injection vulnerabilities auto detect tool.

At private, developing simple-tool which works in a browser.  

Loving frameworks (libraries) down below.

- Vue.js
- React
- Next.js
- Nuxt.js
- elm

Prefering TypeScript to javaScript.
